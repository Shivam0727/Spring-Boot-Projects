# CREATING REST API :

In this project we implement 4 types of API's :

## POST

## GET

## PUT

## DELETE

### Creating a REST API with Spring Boot involves several steps. Below, I'll provide a basic outline of the process and key components you'll need to consider.

# Setup Spring Boot Project:

Create a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE or Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/).

Choose dependencies like Spring Web to include the necessary libraries for building a web application.

# Project Structure:

Organize your project into packages for better maintainability (e.g., controller, service, repository, model).

## Model:

Define your data model using Java classes. These classes represent the entities you'll be working with in your API.

    @Entity
    public class YourEntity {
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        private Long id;
        private String name;
        // other fields, getters, setters, etc.
    }

## Repository:

Create a repository interface extending JpaRepository for database operations.

    public interface YourEntityRepository extends JpaRepository<YourEntity, Long> {
        // custom queries if needed
    }

## Service:

Create a service class to implement business logic.

    @Service
    public class YourEntityService {
        @Autowired
        private YourEntityRepository repository;

        public List<YourEntity> getAllEntities() {
            return repository.findAll();
        }
        // other service methods
    }

## Controller:

Implement REST endpoints in a controller class.

    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("/api/entities")
    public class YourEntityController {
        @Autowired
        private YourEntityService service;

        @GetMapping
        public ResponseEntity<List<YourEntity>> getAllEntities() {
            List<YourEntity> entities = service.getAllEntities();
            return new ResponseEntity<>(entities, HttpStatus.OK);
        }
        // other endpoints
    }

# Configure Database:

Set up your database configuration in application.properties or application.yml.

# Run the Application:

Run your Spring Boot application. By default, it will be available at http://localhost:8080.

## Test Endpoints:

Use tools like Postman or curl to test your API endpoints.

This is a basic outline, and you can expand on it based on your project requirements. You may need to handle exceptions, implement authentication and authorization, and add more features depending on your use case. Additionally, consider using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to control the data exchanged between the client and server.
